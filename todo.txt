* Done with refactor for TopicModel/TopicData

  Still need to make sure dates are populated
  correctly on updates and when adding a new
  topic. See resulting data from unit tests


* Topic validation: title must not be duplicate

* RSS feed

* Handle corrupted json list

* Session & authentication

* Versioning topics

* A decent editor/use markdown

d instanceof Date && isFinite(d)
