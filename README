A very simple blog web site using Node.js and Express.js

This is a rough work in progress.

At this point there is code to handle a home page, an about page, a way to see a list of topics, and click on each topic to view the details of the post.

The data is kept in text files for now.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
To run this code you'll need to have installed Node.js and Express.js on your machine.

HOW TO RUN IT
-------------
Once Node.js and Express.js are on your system you just need to run:

   node app.js 

Browse to your localhost:3000 and you should see the rather anticlimactic web site with the beginnings of what will eventually be a blog engine.


QUESTIONS, COMMENTS, THOUGHTS?
------------------------------
This is a very rough work in progress as I learn and play with Node.js.

Feel free to contact me with questions or comments about this project.
