A very simple blog web site using Node.js, CoffeeScript, and Express.js

This is a rough work in progress.

At this point there is code to handle a home page, an about page, a way to see a list of topics, and click on each topic to view the details of the post.

The data is kept in text files for now.



REQUIREMENTS
------------
To run this code you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. If you don't have Node.js you can get it from http://nodejs.org

In addition to Node.js you'll need CoffeeScript. Once you've installed Node.js you can easily install CoffeeScript from the Terminal with the following command: 

	npm install -g coffee-script

Last but not least, you'll need to install Express and Jade by running the following commands from the Terminal:

	npm install express
	npm install jade

CoffeeScript is a language that compiles to JavaScript. It allow us to write the code with a cleaner syntax than raw JavaScript. http://coffeescript.org/

Express is JavaScript module that takes care of the boiler plate code to handle HTTP requests and responses. http://expressjs.com

Jade is a template engine for Node.js. A tool to help you build HTML without having to do a bunch of string contatenation. http://jade-lang.com



HOW TO RUN IT
-------------
From the Terminal window run the main app.js file: 

   coffee app 

...and browse to your localhost:3000 You should see the rather anticlimactic web site with the beginnings of what will eventually be a blog engine. Enjoy it!



QUESTIONS, COMMENTS, THOUGHTS?
------------------------------
This is a very rough work in progress as I learn and play with Node.js.
