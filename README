A very simple blog web site using Node.js and Express.js

This is a rough work in progress.

At this point there is code to handle a home page, an about page, a way to see a list of topics, and click on each topic to view the details of the post.

The data is kept in text files for now.



REQUIREMENTS
------------
To run this code you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. Get it from here: http://nodejs.org/

After that install Express and Jade by running the following commands from the Terminal/command prompt:

  npm install express
  npm install jade

Express is JavaScript module that takes care of the boiler plate code to handle HTTP requests and responses. http://expressjs.com

Jade is a template engine for Node.js. A tool to help you build HTML without having to do a bunch of string contatenation. http://jade-lang.com



HOW TO RUN IT
-------------
From the Terminal window run the main app.js file: 

   node app.js 

...and browse to your localhost:3000 You should see the rather anticlimactic web site with the beginnings of what will eventually be a blog engine. Enjoy it!



QUESTIONS, COMMENTS, THOUGHTS?
------------------------------
This is a very rough work in progress as I learn and play with Node.js.

Feel free to contact me with questions or comments about this project.
